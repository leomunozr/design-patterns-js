# Strategy pattern

- Using composition rather than inheritance.
- Given a family of algorithms, incapusulate each one and makes it interchangable.
- Lets the algorithm vary independently of the client that uses it
- Decouple algorithm from client (client does not have to vary if the algorithm changes).
- Avoids duplicated code
