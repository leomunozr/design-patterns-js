# Abstract factory pattern 

- Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objetcts without specifying their concrete classes.
- The factory interface only specifies that it creates things of type product a or type product b, but it doesn't specify what concrete product a or concrete product b it produces, that is the job of any concrete product factory.
